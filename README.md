# Make Change Project

## Overview
This cash register calculates the change due to a customer, 
given user inputs for the purchase price and amount tendered. 
Calculates and displays the quantity and types of U.S. currency
that make up the total change due, 
using the largest bill and coin denominations possible. 

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Eclipse
- Git

## Lessons Learned
- Used if/else conditionals to determine whether the amount tendered is insufficient or exactly the purchase price, 
whether change is due, or whether to display an error for invalid numeric entries.
- Created variables using double and String inputs from user with Scanner utility.
- Nested control statements to determine whether each bill/coin denomination factored among the change due, 
that execute denomination counting and display methods when true. 
- Developed a for-loop to count the whole quantity of each denomination divisible into a running change total.  
- Employed do-while loops to continue the cash register until prompted to close by the user.
- Rounded or casted data values depending upon output, to display quantities or currencies clearly.
